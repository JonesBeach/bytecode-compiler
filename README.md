# Interactive Bytecode Compiler

![Bytecode Compiler](demo.gif)

## Introduction

This repo contains an interactive Python bytecode compiler, built using React about powered by [Memphis](https://github.com/JonesBeach/memphis).

As a result, it does not support the full CPython [dis module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dis.html), but rather an in-progress [feature set](https://github.com/JonesBeach/memphis/blob/main/docs/SUPPORTED.md).

An embedded version can be found on [From Scratch Code](https://fromscratchcode.com/bytecode-compiler/).

## Local Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
